<h1>Deploy an Azure Container Registry</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab will Deploy an Azure Container Registry resource.<br /><br />
Azure Container Registry (ACR) is a managed, private Docker registry service provided by Microsoft Azure. It allows developers and organizations to store and manage Docker container images securely. With Azure Container Registry, you can create and maintain your container images while integrating seamlessly with other Azure services such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Container Instances (ACI), and Azure DevOps.
<br /><br />
Key features of Azure Container Registry include:
<br /><br />
<b>Private Registry:</b> Azure Container Registry enables you to create private Docker registries, ensuring that your container images are accessible only to authorized users.
<br />
<b>Integration with Azure Services:</b> ACR integrates seamlessly with other Azure services like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Container Instances (ACI), Azure DevOps, and Azure App Service, making it easier to deploy containerized applications on Azure.
<br />
<b>Geo-replication:</b> Azure Container Registry supports geo-replication, allowing you to replicate your container images to multiple Azure regions for improved availability and faster container image pulls.
<br />
<b>Security:</b> ACR provides built-in security features such as role-based access control (RBAC), Azure Active Directory integration, and image signing to ensure that your container images are secure and compliant with organizational policies.
<br />
<b>Scalability:</b> Azure Container Registry is designed to scale according to your needs, supporting large-scale container deployments with high availability and performance.
<br />
<b>Registry Tasks:</b> ACR includes Registry Tasks, which allow you to automate common container image tasks such as building, testing, and deploying container images directly from your source code repository.
<br />
Overall, Azure Container Registry simplifies the process of managing container images in the cloud, providing a secure and reliable platform for containerized applications on Azure.
